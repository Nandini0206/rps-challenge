# RPS Weekend Challenge

## Task
----

Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

## User Stories
----

As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors


## Hints on functionality

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock


As usual please start by

* Forking this repo
* TEST driving development of your app


## Bonus level 1: Multiplayer

Change the game so that two marketeers can play against each other ( _yes there are two of them_ ).

## Bonus level 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard

## Steps

1. Write a test so the user can enter their name.
2. Write the code so the name is displayed when user presses play.
3. Write the test and code for the Rock, Paper, Scissors buttons.
4. Write test and code for displaying which button was selected.
5. Create a computer option which generates a button at random.
6. Write test and code to decide winner.

## How to Use
